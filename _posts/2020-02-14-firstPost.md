原本就打算今年要好好培養寫作習慣  
在看了以下幾篇文章之後, 才決定要弄一個每日學習記錄空間  
希望以此部落格來訓練思維  

### [刻意練習](http://teddy-chen-tw.blogspot.com/2016/04/blog-post_28.html)
### [每一篇心得都有價值](https://medium.com/hulis-blog/why-blogging-ab77fd8c6ffa)
### [我為什麼鼓勵工程師寫blog](https://dotblogs.com.tw/hatelove/2017/03/26/why-engineers-should-keep-blogging)


> 藉由這個空間來培養自己能以一個有系統, 有組織的方式來呈現內化後的知識的能力
(好拗口...) 

```
When people ask me for advice on blogging,  
I always respond with yet another form of the same advice:  
pick a schedule you can live with, and stick to it.   
Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter.   
I don't care if you suck at writing.   
I don't care if nobody reads your blog.   
I don't care if you have nothing interesting to say.   
If you can demonstrate a willingness to write,   
and a desire to keep continually improving your writing,   
you will eventually be successful.  
```
